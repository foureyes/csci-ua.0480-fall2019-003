-- country
-----------------------------------------------------
-- 1. if we make a name column in our new table, how big should
--    the varchar be?
select max(char_length(release_country)) from staging_movie;


-- 2. create country table
create table country (
   country_id serial,
   name varchar(50) not null,
   primary key(country_id)
);

-- 3. what are the possible country values?
select distinct release_country from staging_movie;


-- 4. populate country table using staging data
-- use subquery to do this:
-- INSERT INTO table_name ( column_name [, ...] )
--    query
--  see:
--  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-insert.html
-- subquery returns table! value from table inserted...
insert into country (name)

-- 5. let's check our results... do we have any countries?
select * from country limit 15;

-- 6. do number of countries match?
--    subqueries return single value

-- individual queries first
select count(*) from country;
select count(distinct release_country) from staging_movie;

-- filming_location
-----------------------------------------------------
-- 1. check out the filming locations from staging
select distinct filming_locations from staging_movie;

-- 2. create a filming_location table
drop table if exists filming_location;
create table filming_location (
  filming_location_id serial,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  country_id integer references country(country_id),
  primary key(filming_location_id)
);
  -- immediately raise an error if an attempt to delete the referenced
  -- country is made
  -- country_id integer references country(country_id) on delete restrict not null,

-- 3. try breaking up filming location:
-- use a subquery to split filming_locations into an array
-- note that subquery in from must have alias
-- ... display the entire array, its length, and the last element

-- breaking into an Array
select string_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc from staging_movie limit 10;

-- use result as table and query into it! ... get some info about arrays
select loc, array_length(loc, 1), loc[array_length(loc, 1)]
    from (select string_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc from staging_movie limit 10) location;

-- do we mostly have countries?
select  distinct(loc[array_length(loc, 1)])
from (select string_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc from staging_movie) location;

--  uh... whitespace?
select  distinct(trim(loc[array_length(loc, 1)]))
from (select string_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc from staging_movie) location;

-- it WORKS!

-- 4. now that we know we can break it up, let's see if we can get the
-- the last part as the country, and everything before it as a "location"

select array_to_string(loc[1:array_length(loc, 1) - 1], ',') as loc_name,
       trim(loc[array_length(loc, 1)]) as countr_name
from
    (select string_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc from staging_movie) as location;

-- 5. use a common table expression (CTE) / SELECT in WITH ... to save
-- the previous query as a one-time use "temporary table"
-- trim the values to remove white space surrounding string
-- cte can be self referencing, subqueries cannot ... let's try one out
-- perf should be the same
with loc_temp as (
    select array_to_string(loc[1:array_length(loc, 1) - 1], ',') as loc_name,

)
select distinct country_name, country.country_id, country.name
from loc_temp left join country on country.name = loc_temp.country_name;

-- 6. fill in any additional countries that need to be added using cte
-- and left outer join (this will show us all locations that don't have
-- a corresponding country in the country table... we'll exclude places
-- that are not title case
with loc_temp as (
    select  trim(array_to_string(loc[1:array_length(loc, 1)-1], ',')) as loc_name,
            trim(loc[array_length(loc, 1)]) as country_name
    from
         (select regexp_split_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc
          from staging_movie) as loc
)
insert into country (name)
select distinct country_name
from loc_temp left outer join country on country.name = loc_temp.country_name
where country_id is null
and country_name is not null
and initcap(country_name) = country_name;

-- 7. finally insert locations
with loc_temp as (
    select  trim(array_to_string(loc[1:array_length(loc, 1)-1], ',')) as loc_name,
            trim(loc[array_length(loc, 1)]) as country_name
    from
         (select regexp_split_to_array(filming_locations, ',') as loc
          from staging_movie) as loc
)
insert into filming_location (name, country_id)
select distinct loc_name, country_id
from loc_temp inner join country on country.name = loc_temp.country_name;

-- 8. run checks to see results; we can see that there's a difference
-- in counts due to some locations not being added (spacing, last
-- element not title case, etc.)
select * from filming_location;
select count(*) from filming_location;
select count(distinct filming_locations) from staging_movie;

select filming_location.name, country.name
from filming_location
inner join country
    on country.country_id = filming_location.country_id;
