# Assignment #3 - Cleaning and Preparing Data - Due Friday, Oct 4th at 11pm

In this assignment, you'll create a single notebook (`ipynb`) that contains documentation and code. In the notebook, you should:

https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us

1. find a data set that requires some cleaning and transformation
2. explore and document the data set
3. clean / prepare the data
4. run summary statistics
5. create visualizations
6. answer the questions that you documented earlier

## Part 1 - Finding a Data Set

#### Find a data set to explore

Find a a __new__ data set that's meaningful to you from sources that have some information regarding the provenance of the data (_where did it come from!?_). Check out some [sources here](../data-sets.html). Some guidelines:

1. <span class="hl">don't use the dog bites data set</span> (or _really_, any other data set that we've used in class, because, uh... we already cleaned it üôÅ)
2. (for the next part) write <span class="hl">code that's different from the programs that we've done in class</span> (it's not adequate to simply use class sample code with a different data set üôÖ)

#### Write some documentation and start a notebook called `homework02a.ipynb`:

Again, as with previous homeworks, describe the data set that you're working with.

1. In a markdown cell, describe the data that you've selected
	* link to any documentation about the data that you've found 
	* discuss the origin of the data (what is it, who collected / generated it, how did they do it, etc.)
	* describe why you are interested in it 

## Part 2 - Selecting a Data Set

* to do this, you'll take some time to find a data set that requires clean up and / transformation
	* list a few (2 ~ 3)  questions that you think this data set may answer
2. Using code, show a small part of the data
	* you can download the data beforehand and read it from a file
	* ...or you can retrieve the data from the web
	* display a substring (perhaps the first 200 or 300 characters)
3. Document the format of the data in a markdown cell
	* describe the fields / column headers 
	* determine the _likely_ data type (you can use regular python types or numpy types) of each field
4. Describe the problems (or potential transformations) that are present in the data and the process you'll use to clean / prepare it 
	* keep this high-level (you don't have to mention specific tools / code)
	* assume that your goal is to clean up the data so that you can calculate some descriptive statistics about it
	* ...and answer some of the questions that you've asked

## Part 3 - Clean or Prepare the Data

1. Using the documentation that you wrote earlier in your notebook, write code to clean up and/or prepare your data
	* ‚ö†Ô∏è <span class="hl">if your data set is already clean, then make sure that you make significant transformations to the data</span>
	* these transformations _should_ be done with the intent of helping answer your questions
2. üôÖAgain, don't copy our previous in-class programs to do this
3. You can do this in regular Python (including any built-in modules, like `csv`) or `pandas` (you'll do it again with or without pandas in the last part)
4. Comment your code or add markdown cells as you proceed
5. Periodically show rows / subsets of the data (keep these data samples short so as not to make the notebook unnecessarily long) as you work through your data

## Part 4 - Stats 

1. Use your newly clean data to calculate some descriptive statistics on some columns (outliers with min and max for a column, mean, median, etc.)
2. In a mix of markdown cells and code, try to run some simple analysis to answer your questions that you came up with earlier in your notebook
	* (it's ok if you can't answer your questions üòÖ - just describe the challenges your encountered)

## Part 5 - Visualizations

## Part 6 - Answering Questions
